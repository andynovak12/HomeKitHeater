# HomeKitHeater

This repo contains the code for putting my heater on HomeKit as a thermostat, by using an ESP8266 microcontroller and a relay. This blog post describes the full setup. - ADD LINK

I heavily relied on this library and its examples: https://github.com/Mixiaoxiao/Arduino-HomeKit-ESP8266. Many thanks Mixiaoxiao for all the work put into it.
